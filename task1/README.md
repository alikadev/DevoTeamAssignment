# _DevoTeam_'s Assignement Task 1

## The first task of _DevoTeam_'s backend programming assignement 

This is the first task of _DevoTeam_'s backend programming assignement. I solved it in C because this is an easy programming language and I am comfortable with this language.

This application has been made to run on POSIX environnement (like Linux or MacOS). It has been tested on theses OSes.

# Quick start

To compile this program, you need a C compiler (like `gcc` or `clang`) and `make`.

``` shell
# Build for user needs
make all
# Build with debug informations
make debug
```

# Execute the program

``` shell
./task1 <input file>
```

The program will let you know if you haven't give all the arguments.
